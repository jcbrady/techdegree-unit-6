        .about-bio

          p I've worked with some aspect of the web for over 20 years! I'm always fascinated by the way technology functions, especially from a design perspective. For example, Modularity is a key design principle and it's essential to all successful web projects, whether you're writing code or designing a user interface. Modularity also makes sense when managing teams. 
          p I can be an effective team member and leader working for your company and using the principle of modularity. That said, I have experience not only with technology, but with being human. While I like technology, I love humanity and I'm aware of the dangers of becoming some sort of "iterative tech-insect," yikes!  
          p In all seriousness, emotional intelligence and well-being will always be a core value of mine, from this day forward! I believe productivity spawns naturally from clear thinking, healty humans. It's the only kind of productivity I want to be a part of and I hope you agree!   
          p If so, please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience. I look forward to meeting you!
